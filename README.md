# Event-Sourcing-Admin-Bundle

This bundle provides a dashboard for
the [patchlevel/event-sourcing](https://github.com/patchlevel/event-sourcing) library. This needs
the [patchlevel/event-sourcing-bundle](https://github.com/patchlevel/event-sourcing-bundle) to work properly.

This bundle was initially designed as an DX tool for development but it can also be run on production. If you want to
run it in production be sure to place it behind a login / security measure. Otherwise you will risk that somebody would
mess with your subscriptions, gather internal information about your system and users.
